# Result - A library providing better error handling in C

> [!WARNING]
> Result is a library in beta development stage. Its API can change before the 1.0 release.

**Result** provides a special wrapper for return types that prohibits retriving the return value without checking for errors while making the handling of those errors easier.

**Result** is designed to be a direct replacement to the libc __errno__ variable, providing tools to easly convert between the two.
